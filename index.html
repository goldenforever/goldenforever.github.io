# Simplifying Web Development

@MENU: To dos, Requirements Specification, Components, Design, Documentation@
## To Dos
- Fix top header v spacing
- Fix **&amp;lt;** in code bug

## Requirements Specification

From the specification:

> The method should be:
> - fast to write (important)
> - require little knowledge of web languages (important)
> - further accommodate those with knowledge of web development
> - documented

> The resulting website should have:
> - a level of consistency
> - content-aware display
> - basic modern styling
> - responsive design
> - fast to load
> - small (file size) without compromising functionality

### Targets

The project aims to have a balance between 'one-size fits all'
and aggressively context-predictive content display.

I will set this balance to be that which satisfies 95% of
the population for quantifiable metrics.

 Objective          | Target
--------------------|:-------------:
Fast to write       | ***to be minimised***
Little knowledge    | ***to be minimised***
Further accommodate | Each web language could still be easily included
Documented          | All encompassing documentation
Consistency         | The website should have continuity of style
Content-aware       | At minimum, looks for different 'types' of page content to match
Modern style        | Use modern principles and generally not look dated
Responsive design   | ***see below***
Fast to load        | ***see below***
Small file size     | ***see below***

#### Responsive design
* This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
[This table](http://www.rapidtables.com/web/dev/screen-resolution-statistics.htm)
shows popular screen resolutions.

360x640           | 9:16          | 2.3%      |
1920x1200         | 8:5           | 1.7%      | 24" monitor
720x1280          | 9:16          | 1.6%      | 4.8" Galaxy S
480x800           | 3:5           | 1.1%      |
1360x768          | 16:9          | 0.9%      |
1280x720          | 16:9          | 0.9%      | 720p TV
                  |               | **84.1%** |

The 320x480 of the first three generations of the iPhone seem to provide
a lower bound as they are responsible for over 5% of web-page loads.

The 1920x1080 resolution will serve as an upper bound as larger screens are
responsible for less than 5% of web-page loads.

For the same reason, the screen will need to support resolutions between
16:9 in landscape to 16:9 in portrait.

*i.e. all of these*
(provided the short side is at least 320px, and the long side is no more than 1920px):

#### Fast to load / Small file size
As part of Ofcom's duties as a regulator, they used 
[this data](http://media.ofcom.org.uk/content/posts/news/2015/one-in-three-uk-broadband-superfast)
from SamKnows (11/2014).

The minimum average download speed for a currently offered service (and over 99.5% in use are) in the UK is
7.5Mbit/s. Google says a website should aim to have loaded within a second and
so = 7.5(1-x)Mbits where x is the time taken to create the website.

Therefore I will sit an upper bound on 7.5Mbits as the size of the website *including* the assets.

The average size of the images on a web-page is 1.4Mbits {http://httparchive.org/trends.php},
so I will subtract the size of these assets from the upper bound to make a new
***upper bound of 6.1Mbits***.

Video would not affect the initial loading time on most modern browsers as it is part of the HTML5 standard.

Adding hosted libraries (js/css/fonts) through runtime adding of links seems to
be a very logical way to mitigate this upper bound whilst still retaining a
wide range of output formats. For example, in the case I have no icons, then I
need not include icons

## Components

**Markdown** will be used as the base of the idea.

**GFM** (**G**ithub **F**lavoured **M**arkdown) is the variant of Markdown which is used by Github.

There are some open licence JavaScript Markdown parsers.

Parser       || markdown-js  | marked       | &#181;markdown | Showdown
:-----------:||:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------:
Size (bytes) || 16,750       | 16,528       | 10,097         | 26,423
Speed (x1000)|| 17191ms      | 3727ms       | n/a            | 17191ms
Supports GFM || @ICON:times@ | @ICON:check@ | @ICON:times@   | @ICON:check@

## Design

I will need to add some syntax to Markdown to allow the user to add web objects.

Markdown already uses most of the unicode characters for its syntax.

As there are many more objects to be added, a user would not want to learn a different
one for each one, and few of the web objects to be added have a visually similar code
equivalent, a general markdown web object is needed. This will be the start point of most
objects, though if there are some objects that clearly would benefit from special syntax,
this `,` and `|` were chosen as they would prevent `@` from being read as
Markdown in the case that someone wanted to write an email address.

A choice of three delimiters allow flexibility in the way the website
can be written, though I would recommend making the object uppercase and 
giving the first delimiter a different character to the others as good 
practice, as then someone reading it could easily differentiate the object
and its arguments.


#### Example
If I wanted to create a menu that opens 
'*Home*', '*Services*', '*About Us*' and '*Contact*', I could write:

```none
@MENU:Home, "Services", About Us, Contact
```

which would become something like:

@MENU:Home, "Services", About Us, Contact

And if I wanted to underline some text, I could write:

```none
...@UNDERLINE:this is now underlined@...
```
which would become: 

> ...@UNDERLINE:this is now underlined@...

## Documentation

Most simple elements in the language are rendered from **Markdown**.

Some have been added from **GFM** - *Github Flavoured Markdown* - which is essentially Markdown with
a few helpful changes and extensions used for project documentation on Github.

The rest have been specially added to accommodate web development. Most of these are in the
*general web object* form.

HTML, CSS and JS have mixed support.
- HTML should not be used within objects (except paragraphs or blockquotes)
- Markdown will not be changed to HTML inside a HTML tag other than the body tag

@ HSPACE: 30px @ <span style="color:green">@ICON:thumbs-up@</span> `<span>Hello!</span>`

@ HSPACE: 30px @ <span style="color:green">@ICON:thumbs-up@</span> `> <span>Hello!</span>`

@ HSPACE: 30px @ <span style="color:green">@ICON:thumbs-up@</span> `I'd like to say "<span>Hello!</span>"`

@ HSPACE: 30px @ <span style="color:red">@ICON:thumbs-down@</span> `## <span>Hello!</span>`

- CSS and JS are fully supported externally, internally and (where HTML is supported) inline.
- JavaScript scripts in the head of the document should be placed below the FreeDOM script.

Example document <`head`>
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="myStyle.css">
<script src="freeDOM.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="myOtherStyle.css">
<!-- v~- you must put scripts below the freeDOM.js file -->
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

### Markdown

*This guide has been adapted from https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/.*

#### Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

```markdown
On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer"
spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.

On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer
near the city of Los Angeles.
```

> On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer"
> spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.
> 
> On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer
> near the city of Los Angeles.

#### Headings

You can create a heading by adding one or more `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` 
you use will determine the size of the heading.

```markdown
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
...
###### The 6th largest heading (smallest allowed)
```

> <h1>The largest heading</h1>
> <h2>The second largest heading</h2>
> ...
> <h6>The 6th largest heading (smallest allowed)</h6>

#### Blockquotes

You can indicate [blockquote](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) with a `&gt;`.

```markdown
In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

> Pardon my french
```

> In the words of Abraham Lincoln:
> 
> > Pardon my french

#### Styling text

You can make text **[bold](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong)** or *[italic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em)*.

```markdown
*This text will be italic* and
**this text will be bold**
```

> *This text will be italic* and
> **this text will be bold**

Both **bold** and *italic* can use either a `*` or an `_` around the text for styling

This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed.

```markdown
*Everyone __must__ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.*
```

> *Everyone __must__ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.*

#### Unordered lists

You can make an [unordered list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) by preceding list items with either a `*` or a `-`.
four
```markdown
* Item
* Item
* Item

- Item
- Item
- Item
```

#### Ordered lists

You can make an [ordered list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) by preceding list items with a number.

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

#### Nested lists

You can create nested lists by indenting list items by four spaces.

```markdown
1. Item 1
    1. A corollary to the above item.
    2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
    * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
        * This is indented eight spaces, because 
          it's four spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3
```

> 1. Item 1
>     1. A corollary to the above item.
>     2. Yet another point to consider.
> 2. Item 2
>     * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
>         * This is indented eight spaces, because 
>           it's four spaces further than the item above.
>     * You might want to consider making a new list.
> 3. Item 3

#### Inline formats

Use single backticks (`) to format text in a special monospace format. Everything within the backticks appear as-is, with no other special formatting.

```markdown
Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject`
and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.
```

> Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.

#### Multiple lines

You can use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to format text as its own distinct block.

Check out this neat program I wrote:
<pre><code class="hljs markdown"
>```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```
</code></pre>

> ```
> x = 0
> x = 2 + 2
> what is x
> ```

#### Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets and wrapping the link in parentheses ( `( )` ).

```[Visit my GitHub!](https://www.github.com/goldenforever)```.

> [Visit my GitHub!](https://www.github.com/goldenforever)

#### Images

You may also create an image from a link to an image by putting an exclamation mark in front of the link:

```![Alt text for cat picture](images/cat.jpg)```

> ![Alt text for cat picture](images/cat.jpg)

### GFM
