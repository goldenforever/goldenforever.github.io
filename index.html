## Requirements Specification

From the specification:

The method should be:
- fast to write (important)
- require little knowledge of web languages (important)
- further accommodate those with knowledge of web development
- documented

The resulting website should have:
- a level of consistency
- content-aware display
- basic modern styling
- responsive design
- fast to load
- small (file size) without compromising functionality

The project aims to have a balance between 'one-size fits all'
and aggressively context-predictive content display.

I will set this balance to be that which satisfies 95% of
the population for quantifiable metrics.

--------------------|:-------------:
Fast to write       | ***to be optimised***
Little knowledge    | ***to be optimised***
Further accommodate | Each web language could still be easily included
Documented          | All encompassing documentation
Consistency         | The website should have continuity of style
Content-aware       | At minimum, looks for different 'types' of page content to match
Modern style        | Use modern principles and generally not look dated
Responsive design   | *see below*
Fast to load        | *see below*
Small file size     | *see below*

#### Responsive design
- Min expectable size
- Max expectable size
#### Fast to load
