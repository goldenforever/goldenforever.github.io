## Requirements Specification

From the specification:

> The method should be:
> - fast to write (important)
> - require little knowledge of web languages (important)
> - further accommodate those with knowledge of web development
> - documented

> The resulting website should have:
> - a level of consistency
> - content-aware display
> - basic modern styling
> - responsive design
> - fast to load
> - small (file size) without compromising functionality

### Targets

The project aims to have a balance between 'one-size fits all'
and aggressively context-predictive content display.

I will set this balance to be that which satisfies 95% of
the population for quantifiable metrics.

 Objective          | Target
--------------------|:-------------:
Fast to write       | ***to be minimised***
Little knowledge    | ***to be minimised***
Further accommodate | Each web language could still be easily included
Documented          | All encompassing documentation
Consistency         | The website should have continuity of style
Content-aware       | At minimum, looks for different 'types' of page content to match
Modern style        | Use modern principles and generally not look dated
Responsive design   | ***see below***
Fast to load        | ***see below***
Small file size     | ***see below***

#### Responsive design

This table (http://www.rapidtables.com/web/dev/screen-resolution-statistics.htm)
shows popular screen resolutions.

1024x768          | 4:3           | 3.9%      | 15" monitor
1680x1050         | 8:5           | 2.8%      | 22" monitor
360x640           | 9:16          | 2.3%      |

480x800           | 3:5           | 1.1%      |
1360x768          | 16:9          | 0.9%      |
1280x720          | 16:9          | 0.9%      | 720p TV
                  |               | **84.1%** |

The 320x480 of the first three generations of the iPhone seem to provide
a lower bound as they are responsible for over 5% of web-page loads.

The 1920x1080 resolution will serve as an upper bound as larger screens are
responsible for less than 5% of web-page loads.

For the same reason, the screen will need to support resolutions between
16:9 in landscape to 16:9 in portrait.

*i.e. all of these*
(provided the short side is at least 320px, and the long side is no more than 1920px):

#### Fast to load
- Max time allowed to load

#### Small file size
As part of Ofcom's duties as a regulator, they used the following data from SamKnows (11/2014).

http://media.ofcom.org.uk/content/posts/news/2015/one-in-three-uk-broadband-superfast

The minimum average download speed for a currently offered service (and over 99.5% in use are) in the UK is
7.5Mbit/s. Google says a website should aim to have loaded within a second and
so = 7.5(1-x)Mbits where x is the time taken to create the website.

Therefore I will sit an upper bound on 7.5Mbits as the size of the website *including* the assets.

The average size of the images on a web-page is 1.4Mbits {http://httparchive.org/trends.php},
so I will subtract the size of these assets from the upper bound to make a new
***upper bound of 6.1Mbits***.

Adding hosted libraries (js/css/fonts) through runtime adding of links seems to
be a very logical way to mitigate this upper bound whilst still retaining a
wide range of output formats.

I would account Adobe Flash into my calculations but since YouTube has moved to using a
HTML5 player instead, mean usage has reduced by approximately 40% and is now less than
half of the mean font transfer size.

## Components

Markdown will be used as the base of the idea

## Design

After studying the 

I will need to add some syntax to Markdown to allow the user to add web objects.

Markdown already uses most of the unicode characters for its syntax.

As there are many more objects to be added, a user would not want to learn a different
one for each one, and few of the web objects to be added have a visually similar code
equivalent, a general markdown web object is needed.

This will have the added benefit of making the transition from having used Markdown
before much simpler.

HTML and Markdown both have block and inline elements. Therefore, it makes sense to make
a syntax for both.

#### EBNF syntax:

    block   = content [close];
    inline  = content close;
    
    content = open object {delim {" "} argument {" "}};
    object  = char {char};
    char    = upper | lower
    upper   = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
            | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
            | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
            | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" ;
    lower   = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g"
            | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n"
            | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u"
            | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;

#### Initial choices for the actual characters:

    open  = '@';
    close = '@';
    delim = ':' | ',' | '|';

##### Logic

`@` is not used in Markdown to describe syntax. It is also an unintimidating choice,
as it is a common character to anyone who uses the web.

`:`, `,` and `|` were chosen as they would prevent `@` from being read as
Markdown in the case that someone wanted to write an email address.

A choice of three delimiters allow flexibility in the way the website
can be written, though I would recommend making the object uppercase and 
giving the first delimiter a different character to the others as good 
practice, as then someone reading it could easily differentiate the 

#### Example
If I wanted to create a menu that opens 
'*Home*', '*Services*', '*About Us*' and '*Contact*', I could write:

    ...
    @MENU:Home, "Services", 'About Us', Contact
    ...
    
And if I wanted to underline some text, I would write:

    ...@UNDERLINE:this is now underlined@...
