## Requirements Specification

From the specification:

The method should be:
- fast to write (important)
- require little knowledge of web languages (important)
- further accommodate those with knowledge of web development
- documented

The resulting website should have:
- a level of consistency
- content-aware display
- basic modern styling
- responsive design
- fast to load
- small (file size) without compromising functionality

The project aims to have a balance between 'one-size fits all'
and aggressively context-predictive content display.

I will set this balance to be that which satisfies 95% of
the population for quantifiable metrics.

 Objective          | Target
--------------------|:-------------:
Fast to write       | ***to be optimised***
Little knowledge    | ***to be optimised***
Further accommodate | Each web language could still be easily included
Documented          | All encompassing documentation
Consistency         | The website should have continuity of style
Content-aware       | At minimum, looks for different 'types' of page content to match
Modern style        | Use modern principles and generally not look dated
Responsive design   | *see below*
Fast to load        | *see below*
Small file size     | *see below*

#### Responsive design
- Min expectable size
- Max expectable size

#### Fast to load
- Max time allowed to load

#### Small file size
As part of Ofcom's duties as a regulator, they used the following data from SamKnows (11/2014).

http://media.ofcom.org.uk/content/posts/news/2015/one-in-three-uk-broadband-superfast

The minimum average download speed for a currently offered service (and over 99.5% in use are) in the UK is
7.5Mbit/s. Google says a website should aim to have loaded within a second and
so = 7.5(1-x)Mbits where x is the time taken to create the website.

Therefore I will sit an upper bound on 7.5Mbits as the size of the website *including* the assets.

The average size of the images on a web-page is 1.4Mbits {http://httparchive.org/trends.php},
so I will subtract the size of these assets from the upper bound to make a new
***upper bound of 6.1Mbit/s***.

Adding hosted libraries (js/css/fonts) through runtime adding of links seems to
be a very logical way to mitigate this upper bound whilst still retaining a
wide range of output formats.

I would account Adobe Flash into my calculations but since YouTube has moved to using a
HTML5 player instead, mean usage has reduced by approximately 40% and is now less than
half of the mean font transfer size.
